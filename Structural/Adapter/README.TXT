Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes

Intent

-Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
-Wrap an existing class with a new interface.
-Impedance match an old component to a new system

Checklist

-Identify the players: the component(s) that want to be accommodated (i.e. the client), and the component that needs to adapt (i.e. the adaptee).
-Identify the interface that the client requires.
-Design a "wrapper" class that can "impedance match" the adaptee to the client.
-The adapter/wrapper class "has a" instance of the adaptee class.
-The adapter/wrapper class "maps" the client interface to the adaptee interface.
-The client uses (is coupled to) the new interface
